# Basic ESP32-CAM configuration

using esp-idf framework and recent I2C bus configuration.

Nevertheless the framerate using ESPhome is really bad. With the native or even rtsp implemetlations you will provide much better performance.
I definetly can not recommend these cameras for surveillance use.

A appropriate use case for these ESP32-CAM devices is https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device
